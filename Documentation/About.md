# About Math Library

## Overview
A compact Unreal Engine 5.0+ runtime library designed to help create game mechanics, procedural content generation and custom tools.

// TODO This library provides essential mathematical utilities that work both at runtime and within the editor, enabling deterministic procedural generation and solve common mathematic problems.

---

// TODO ## Features
- **Runtime & Editor Compatible**: All functions work during gameplay and within editor tools
- **Deterministic Generation**: Seedable random number generator for reproducible results
- **Performance Optimized**: Lightweight implementation suitable for real-time execution
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Every function includes detailed inline explanations

---

## Components

// TODO ### RNG (Random Number Generation)
**Squirrel 13**: Seedable random number generator 
- Gives more random results than unreal random functions
- Supports deterministic generation
